                    <p>Hi, and welcome to my little part of the world wide web. My name is Daniel Thursfield.</p>
                
                
                    
                    <p class="text">I'm a 40 something Swede, currently working as a night receptionist in Denmark for a large hotel chain.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm into all things tech, video games and more or less anything related to it. Apart from that I also enjoy running. Done a few marathons and other races in my days.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is for me to practice and learn web development / programming. In the future this is something I aim to work with. </p></div>
